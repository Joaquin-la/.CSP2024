    <h1>Joaquin's Portfolio</h1>

    <h1> Yogurt Bowl Maker</h1>
        <img src="CS Project.png" height="300">
      </a>
      <p>This was a project in which the user was able to input weather or not they wanted to have it in their bowl, 
        if they did, the turtle would draw it onto the yogurt</p>
      <br>
    <h1>  Indiana Banana </h1>
    <a target="_blank" href="Link">
      <img src="Minion Project.png" height="300">
      </a>
      <p> We created a minion that had to jump over spikes and different 
      obstacles in order to reach the final level where a golden banana was awaiting</p>

    <h1>  Children's Hospital ECard  </h1>
     <a target="_blank" href="Link">
      <img src="ECard.PNG" height="300">
     </a>
     <p> We created an ECard for a children's hospital where the user is asked if they want to hear a joke, 
	if yes, a riddle was displayed on the screen, then you could press "a" to see the answer</p>

    <h1>  Fishtank</h1>
      <img src="Fishtank.PNG" height="300">
	<p> We debugged the code so that we were able to run it without any unexpected errors</p>
    <br>
    <h1>  Cat finds love</h1>
	<iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1096710776/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p> We created a scratch project that was basically a game but a story too. A bear woke a cat up from sleep and took him through a journey to find the love of his life</p>

 <h1>  Rover Data  </h1>
     <a target="_blank" href="Link">
      <img src="Rocky Mountains.jpg" height="300">
     </a>
     <p> We figured out that it was Rocky Mountains since the data for the gyroscope matched the rocky terrain
     and the data for the temperature made sense that it got abruptly hot. The sound also matches with the slow but constant winds </p>	  
	<h1>  3.2.4 </h1>
      <img src="Graph.PNG" height="300">
	<p>  In this project we used matplotlib and pandas to plot graphs of honey production over the years in each state. We used these graphs to draw conclusion of the health of the bees and production of honey.</p>
